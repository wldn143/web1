  <h2>My concern..</h2>
  ..these days is about getting a job.
  And what about my lazy lifestyle?
  <br><br><u>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/945360/Among_Us/">'Among us'</u></a> swallowed up all my vacations.
  I deleted all phone games including that game.
  <p><strong>If I re-install'Among us', I'm trash.</strong></p>

  <p style="margin-top:40px;">The Little Prince (French: Le Petit Prince, pronounced [lə p(ə)ti pʁɛ̃s]) is a novella by French aristocrat, writer, and aviator Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. It was first published in English and French in the US by Reynal & Hitchcock in April 1943, and posthumously in France following the liberation of France as Saint-Exupéry's works had been banned by the Vichy Regime. The story follows a young prince who visits various planets in space, including Earth, and addresses themes of loneliness, friendship, love, and loss. Despite its style as a children's book, The Little Prince makes observations about life and human nature.</p>
